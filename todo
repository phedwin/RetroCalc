0. calculator logic [ts]
 -> basic interactivity[ repl flags -r]
 -> a compiler( this might look like over engineering but it makes sense to have a specific calculator syntax)
  something like this should work ((((((((( 1 + 2 ))))))))) & just any test case
 -> this should support variety of operators but im mostly interested in bits calculation 
1. virtual machine [rust or c or just ts]
 -> RISC
 -> 8 bits width [ just something small]
 -> have 4 registers



2. package the ts application
 ->the vm should run the bin

3. switch to rust build script
 -> this is somehow convinient & easy to debug

4. ship
 -> progress 1 + 1 should work
